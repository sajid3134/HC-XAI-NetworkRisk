# Human-Centered Explainable Network Risk Detection
from Encrypted Mobile Traffic

## Overview
This research explores a human-centered, explainable network security framework
that detects anomalous or risky behavior from privacy-preserving metadata of
encrypted mobile network traffic.

Instead of decrypting traffic, the system analyzes flow-level and statistical
features and translates detected risks into human-understandable explanations,
supporting safer decision-making without compromising user privacy.

## Research Goals
- Detect network risks from encrypted mobile traffic
- Preserve user privacy by avoiding payload inspection
- Provide explainable, human-friendly risk interpretations
- Support non-expert users in understanding network threats


## Repository Purpose
This repository is used to:
- Track daily research activities
- Store individual and group research notes
- Organize literature reviews, datasets, and experiments
- Support collaborative research work
