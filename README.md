# HC-XAI-NetworkRisk
This work presents a human-centered, explainable network security approach that analyzes privacy-preserving metadata from encrypted network traffic to detect anomalous or risky behavior. The system improves user understanding by translating risk signals into clear Bangla-language warnings, supporting safer decisions without compromising privacy.
